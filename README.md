# hello-world


this is the first edit of a branch in my whole life, what exciting times we live in.
what I did the last 25 minutes: I read some on github and followed the initial tutorial here
I created an account at github and apiary
that is it
trying to keep a journal on what I do
getting distracted sometimes
